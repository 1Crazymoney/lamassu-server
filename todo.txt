- l-m shouldn't keep polling l-s when not on pending screen (low priority)

- scrutinize hkdf, maybe use own simplified version
- test bitcoind cash-out
- test eth cash out, check that HD is still working
- throttle status check for 3rd services like bitgo

- load stuff from master config file
- add default configuration

- either remove lamassu-config or fix link in package.json

------------------------

schemas:

- global crypto / global machine
- global crypto / specific machine
- specific crypto / global machine
- specific crypto / specific machine

- We'll have one group for config that applies to all 4
- Machine config applies to only global crypto (machine config screen)
- Crypto config applies to only specific crypto

v update migrate-config to match lamassu.json schema
- update machine name
