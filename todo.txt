- specify crypto and fiat for trades
- make sure ticker is in full coins
- getDeviceRate should return bignumber
- test with l-m

backwards compatibility:

- new l-m must be backwards compatible with old l-s

- parse out bignumber when loading in routes
- making a trade -- convert to units
- clean up db stuff satoshis/cryptoAtoms
- clean up other stuff
