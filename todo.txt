- change satoshis to crypto_atoms in db (ask neal about this)

- on upgrade, make sure we're not sending out lots of notifications to users
  - set notified to true on all transactions before running

- handle redeems
  - if fetchPhoneTx fails for trader, try raqia. Use record to update l-s db, and take it from there.
  - should be safe because:
    - impossible to dispense via raqia, we don't allow access anymore
    - each new fetch will hit l-s db as usual
